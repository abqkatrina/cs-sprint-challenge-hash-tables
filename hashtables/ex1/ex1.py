def get_indices_of_item_weights(weights, length, limit):
    """
    Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
    weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that 
    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Your
    function will return a tuple of integers that has the following form:
    ```
    (zero, one)
    ```
    where vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    _**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and
    the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a
    pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return
    `None`.

    Example:
    ```
    input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
    output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21
    ```
    """
    # more efficient with dict
    cache = {}
    results = ()

    # for each item/weight
    #   *   If we store each weight's list index as its value, we can then check
    #   to see if the hash table contains an entry for `limit - weight`. If it
    #   does, then we've found the two items whose weights sum up to the
    #   `limit`!
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        w = limit - weights[i]
        if w in cache:
            results = (i, cache[w])
        cache[weights[i]] = i

    if len(results) == 2:
        return results
    else:
        return None
